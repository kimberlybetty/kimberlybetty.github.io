# Encryption/Decryption In Mathematics
## Lesson Description: 
Students will explore encryption and description within cybersecurity to determine the importance in protecting information through the use of mathematics; Precalculus: inverse functions, Calculus: derivatives and antiderivatives. Students will then use their encryption/decryption functions to decode a message and then use the result to code Sphero robots. 

## Prerequisite Knowledge: 
Prior to this lesson, students can derive an inverse function and verify _f(f<sup>-1</sup>(x))=x_

## Level of Instruction
his lesson will apply procedural mathematical knowledge of “undoing” a mathematical operation at multiple levels of mathematics. Adapted for either high school College Algebra/Pre-Calculus students learning about inverse functions and for Calculus students learning derivatives and antiderivatives. 

## Applicable First Principles &/or Concepts: 
### GenCyberFirst Principles
* **Domain Seperation**
* **Abstraction**
* Process Isolation
* **Data Hiding**
* Resource Encapsulation
* Layering
* Modularity
* Simplicity
* **Least Privilege**
* Minimization

## GenCyber Cybersecurity Concepts
* Defense in Depth
* Availability
* **Confidentiality**
* Think Like an Adversary
* Integrity
* Keep it Simple

## Resources that are Needed: 
All students will need access to a Sphero and tablet/phone with the app.
Students will need the Encryption function, _E(x)=2x+3_ which if decrypted correctly will become _D(x)= (x-3)/2._

## Accommodations Needed:
Due to the nature of the lesson, this is a supplemental day for Pre-Caclulus students to work on finding inverses and Calculus students finding derivatives with a cross-curricular content. Students can focus on the mathematics skills and write a small summary on encryption for cybersecurity if the content is too difficult. 

# Learning Outcomes
## Lesson Learning Outcomes: 
* Students should be able to determine inverses of functions and apply the concepts of encryption/decryption concepts from cybersecutiy. 
* Students should be able to encrypt and ecrypt numerical strings using functions
* students should be able to program a Sphero robot to move along a specific path.
