#Encryption/Decryption In Mathematics
##Lesson Description: 
Students will explore encryption and description within cybersecurity to determine the importance in protecting information through the use of mathematics; Precalculus: inverse functions, Calculus: derivatives and antiderivatives. Students will then use their encryption/decryption functions to decode a message and then use the result to code Sphero robots. 
##Prerequisite Knowledge: 
Prior to this lesson, students can derive an inverse function and verify ff-1(x)=x
##Level of Instruction
his lesson will apply procedural mathematical knowledge of “undoing” a mathematical operation at multiple levels of mathematics. Adapted for either high school College Algebra/Pre-Calculus students learning about inverse functions and for Calculus students learning derivatives and antiderivatives.
